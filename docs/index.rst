======

Tandem is a scientific software for
:abbr:`SEAS ( Sequences of Earthquakes and Aseismic Slip)` modelling and
for solving Poisson and linear elasticity problems.
It implements the Symmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin (SIPG) method using
unstructured simplicial meshes (triangle meshes in 2D, tetrahedral meshes in 3D).
